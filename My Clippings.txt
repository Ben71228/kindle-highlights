Au temps où l'Empire brillait de toute sa gloire, lors du passage de Napoléon en Espagne, où il envoyait la fleur de ses troupes, les espérances de cette femme, trompées jusqu'alors, se réveillèrent. La curiosité la poussa naturellement à contempler ces héros qui conquéraient l'Europe sur un mot mis à l'Ordre du Jour, et qui renouvelaient les fabuleux exploits de la chevalerie. Les villes les plus avaricieuses et les plus réfractaires étaient obligées de fêter la Garde Impériale, au-devant de laquelle allaient les Maires et les Préfets, une harangue en bouche, comme pour la Royauté. Madame de Bargeton, venue à une redoute offerte par un régiment à la

ville, s'éprit d'un gentilhomme, simple sous-lieutenant à qui le rusé Napoléon avait montré le bâton de maréchal de France. Cette passion contenue, noble, grande, et qui contrastait avec les passions alors si facilement nouées et dénouées, fut chastement consacrée par la main de la mort. A Wagram, un boulet de canon écrasa sur le cœur du marquis de Cante-Croix le seul portrait qui attestât la beauté de madame de Bargeton. Elle pleura long-temps ce beau jeune homme, qui en deux campagnes était devenu colonel, échauffé par la gloire, par l'amour, et qui mettait une lettre de Naïs au-dessus des distinctions impériales. La douleur jeta sur la figure de cette femme un voile de tristesse.

Nous disons tous, plus ou moins, comme Louis XIV : L'Etat, c'est moi ! L'exclusive tendresse de sa mère et de sa sœur, le dévouement de David, l'habitude qu'il avait de se voir l'objet des efforts secrets de ces trois êtres, lui donnaient les vices de l'enfant de famille, engendraient en lui cet égoïsme qui dévore le noble, et que madame de Bargeton caressait en l'incitant à oublier ses obligations envers sa sœur, sa mère et David. Il n'en était rien encore ; mais n'y avait-il pas à craindre, qu'en étendant autour de lui le cercle de son ambition, il fût contraint de ne penser qu'à lui pour s'y maintenir ?
